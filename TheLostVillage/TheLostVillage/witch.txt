Witch: Good morning!
Who are you? Where am I?
Witch: "I found you beside the road and I saved you. Now I have a challenge for you. Will you accept it?
Nah, leave me alone. I just want to leave.
Witch: That's not an option. If you don't take my trial, I will kill you.
I guess I need to take it...
Witch: Great! Take this paper, you will find everything you need on it, be successful!!
I hope I will never see you again!
