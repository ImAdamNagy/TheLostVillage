Greetings! I heard you have an item for me.
Villager: I do indeed. A magical scrool, that you are going to need to fight the dragon.
Will you give it to me?
Villager: Oh I'm not that kind. I will need something in exchange.
And what do you want?
Villager: The Talisman you've just gained from killing that wild animal!
Alright, so be it.
